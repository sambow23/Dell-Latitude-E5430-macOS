# Dell-Latitude-E5430-macOS
Repo for my Dell Latitude E5430 (non-vPro) Hackintosh

Currently everything works including: Sleep, WiFi (DW 1510, requires patch), Audio, KB/Trackpad (VoodooPS2), FN keys, iGPU (QE/CI, Metal), Ethernet, Battery Indicator, Bluetooth, Apple Services.

Default BIOS settings should be fine aside from setting SATA to AHCI
